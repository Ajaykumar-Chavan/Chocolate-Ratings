<h2>About Data</h2>
This dataset is based on chocolate.In this dataset have some categoricl and numerical column like where is chocolate made, which company made, which ingredients includein chocolate etc.

<h2>Insight</h2>
I am solved the question how got ratings to chocolate and which kind.
First here i am imported some libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn for reading data and visualisations.
After import data performed cleansing data  like head columns data tail columns data, columns data types its required to change or not. Is any null value or duplicate value prasent or not.
After cleansing data visualized data created some plots like Frequency of ratings, Raealation between cocoa percent and rating, Average ratings by countries of bean origin, Count of chocolate by company location, average ratings by year etc.
